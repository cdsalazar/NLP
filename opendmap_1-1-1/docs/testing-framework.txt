General Testing Framework
-------------------------

A relatively general testing framework has been created that allows
the DMAP code itself to be tested and also allows users to build their
own tests for larger systems.  This framework does not rely on any 
OpenDMAP code and can be used for other projects as well.

The testing framework is in the Java package edu.uchsc.ccp.testing.

Overview
--------

The testing framework consists of several pieces:
<ul>
<li>The Test Manager
<li>Test Suites
<li>Test Contexts
<li>Test Classes
<li>Test Suite XML Files
</ul>

Building a Testing Framework
----------------------------

There are two key components that need to be implemented to create a 
custom testing framework:

 - A Test Context Java class
 - One or more Test Java classes

One test context object is created and initialized for each test suite 
and it is passed to each test run in the suite.  The test context is 
used to hold any shared state that is required between tests.

A test class defines a <i>type</i> of test that can appear in a test 
suite.  An instance of a test class is created for each test that appears 
in the test suite.  Different types of test require different test classes.
