OpenDMAP 1-1 README 2010-01-10

This release of OpenDMAP is a source release. It does not include dependent jars.
They can be downloaded by running the get_jars.sh script in the ant directory, 
described below.

This release depends on a local install of Protege, available from: 
Protege 3.4.2 is available at: http://protege.stanford.edu/.
Edit the ant file ant/build.properties with the location  of the Protege install.


Mac Users Note: this script uses wget which isn't installed on most systems.
You will need to install Xcode from Apple. Then "macports" (google it).
Finally, you will be able to install wget and its dependencies with the command:
sudo port install wget
see http://wget.darwinports.com/

cd  ant
./get_jars.sh

They are then made available to the build by running the build_jars.sh script

./build_jars.sh

which unzips the downloads and extracts jars from tar files. The code is compiled
with the default ant target:

ant

The ant run includes a run of unit tests.


This build assembles it's own CLASSPATH variables. Some issues have been resolved by
setting the variable to the empty string.

The tests progress with warnings about duplicate patterns. Please ignore them.
